I like to learn about stuff and talk with people (often about more stuff)

Currently finishing up my B.S.Eng. in Durham NC, soon to be working in
Charlotte NC.

## Interests

### Computer-y Stuff
- I like writing code (love functional paradigms but assembly is pretty cute
  too)
- Math (topic depends on the day)
- GNU/Linux (currently running Ubuntu)
- Writing Tests (an aesthetic experience)

### Being a better person
- Ethics and applied philosophy
- Picking up heavy things and putting them down
- Walking around outside (sometimes for multiple days)
- Making cool food
- Talking to cool people
